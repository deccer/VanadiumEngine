# VanadiumEngine
Yet another Vulkan toy "engine". More like a framework for modularizing a renderer, providing increased reusability.

# Building
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/pixelcluster/VanadiumEngine.git
```
Build with CMake as usual.  
Also requires the Vulkan SDK to be installed.
